First make sure you have node.js, yarn and python installed on your computer.

To check if you already have yarn, python and node.js installed on your computer type these commands one by one in the Terminal/Command-line:

yarn -v 

python -v

node -v

If the software is not found or recognized follow the links below for installation

Afterwards follow these steps:

1. Go to the 'Application' folder, e.g. `cd GymTracker/GymTracker_app/Application`

2. Remove cache etc. `rm -rf .cache dist node_modules`

3. Build dependency. `yarn build-dep`

4. Install dependencies. `yarn`

5. Run the demo. `yarn watch`

6. The demo runs at `localhost:1234/?model=movenet`

## Errors mac:
If you encounter errors during step 5 and you have a mac you can try to remove the yarn.lock, package-lock.json and node_module file in Application folder and then run step 5 again.
